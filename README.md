🧑🏾‍🔬 Bio:

_I am applying for my Ph.D. this fall (2024) for the upcoming academic year (2025-2026). If you are accepting applications, let’s talk about our research interests._

I am a Research Associate in the Center for Biobehavioral Heath at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. I hold a particular research interest as a quantified-selfer in implementing Personal Health Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction, and Conversational AI. I am currently working with Dr. Emre Sezgin on applications for AI in the biomedical workspace.
